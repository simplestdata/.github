## Hi there üëã

Simplest Data is dedicated to modernizing learning data infrastructure. Rooted in open standards like [IEEE xAPI 9274](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation) and supported by the [IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) Working Groups](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ltsc/workgroups/) community led research. By reducing friction in educational technologies, we contribute to a more transparent and scalable learning ecosystem‚Äîone defined by ethical design, open collaboration, and a shared commitment to shaping the future of educational interoperability.

- Check out our [**main project**](https://github.com/simplestdata/orientlrs) here. The core of our efforts.
- Learn more how to **self-host via our [docs](https://docs.simplestdata.com).** *coming soon* üöß
- Not interest in hosting yourself? We offer **Simplest Data cloud** for a monthly fee. *coming soon*

### Our Contributions & Approach

- üìö Advocate for lifelong learning systems.
- ü§ù Committed to open-source collaboration and will contribute to the broader IEEE LTSC communities. *All our work is developed and distributed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)*
- üå± Actively participate in standards evolution by testing and reporting on real-world applications.

### Who We Are
