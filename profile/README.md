## Hi there 👋

Our public mission is K‑12 interoperability; this GitHub org is where we ship the developer tooling that makes it real.

**Simplest Data is building a K‑12 learning data infrastructure platform** a practical **data router + integration toolkit** that helps EdTech developers connect learning tools to other tools (and to district/state workflows) using **xAPI (IEEE 9274)**, without forcing "rip-and-replace" changes to existing stacks.

We're starting in **Richmond, VA** and designing for real school constraints: legacy systems, strict data boundaries, and the need for incremental rollout.

---

## What we're building

- **Learning data infra platform** for routing and normalizing learning activity data
- **Data router** patterns to move statements/events between systems reliably
- **Integration toolkit (SDK)** (Python-first) to help vendors and district teams:
  - produce and validate xAPI statements
  - apply profiles/validation rules (where applicable)
  - route data to downstream consumers (analytics, reporting, interoperability services)
  - incrementally integrate without breaking existing workflows

---

## Who this is for

- **EdTech developers** who want a backend "interop layer" to connect their product to other products
- **District/state developers** building standardized data workflows
- **Standards-aligned builders** who want to implement IEEE xAPI 9274 in production contexts

---

## Status / timeline

**Development in progress**  
**Initial release target: February 2026**

---

## Coming soon

- **Developer SDKs** for integrating xAPI workflows faster
- A hands-on **Jupyter/Notebook workspace** with runnable examples and reference implementations
- Example connectors and templates aimed at real K‑12 integration scenarios

---

## Principles

- **Open standards first** (IEEE xAPI 9274 and related work)
- **Incremental adoption** over rip-and-replace
- **Ethical, student-centered data stewardship**
- **Pragmatic engineering** for K‑12 realities

---

## Collaboration model (open + private)

We support both:
- **Open-source components** (to accelerate adoption and shared infrastructure)
- **Private development** (partner-specific integrations, deployments, or constraints)

If you're exploring either path, start a GitHub Discussion with your use case and constraints. Or email us at greg@simplestdata.com
