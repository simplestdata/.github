## Hi there 👋

Simplest Data is developing towards implementing xAPI in K-12 Schools without replacing existing technology stacks, starting in Richmond, VA. Leveraging open standards like [IEEE xAPI 9274](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation) and supported by the [IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) Working Groups](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ltsc/workgroups/) community led research. By reducing friction in educational technologies, we contribute to a more transparent and scalable learning ecosystem—one defined by ethical design, open collaboration, and a shared commitment to shaping the future of educational interoperability.

### DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS - EXPECTED RELEASE FEBRUARY 2026

- Check out [**Yet Analytics - SQL LRS**](https://github.com/yetanalytics/sqlrs) here. This is a clojure based project that is an excellent resource. Simplest Data is using this repo (and overall their work truly) as a 'northern star' reference in our Python based efforts.
- Check out [**Trax LRS**](https://traxlrs.com/) here. This is a php based LRS that sparked this organizations initial interest and curiosity.
- Special shout out to [Yet Analytics](https://www.yetanalytics.com/) CEO / Co-Founder for reaching out and informing me about IEEE LTSC and their work initially - I don't believe I would have dived in otherwise to focus on the systematic data in public schooling otherwise.

### Commitment

- Committed to open-source collaboration and will contribute to the broader [IEEE LTSC](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ltsc/workgroups/) communities.
- Committed to bringing research and technology to Richmond, VA and the greater Commonwealth of Virginia.

### Useful & Fantastic Resources

- [xAPI Base Standard Specifications](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation)
- [xAPI Profiles official documentation](https://adlnet.github.io/xapi-profiles/xapi-profiles-about.html)
- [P92741.1 xAPI Work Group IEEE Page](https://sagroups.ieee.org/9274-1-1/)
- [IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) Active Working Groups - TLA RX](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ltsc/workgroups/)

**Our mission is to enrich our local public school systems with normalized data in Richmond, VA.**
